# OOP Project
A mini face detection project using OpenCV Java.

1. In YuNet.java I used a Face Detection YuNet model, which I also provided the raw version to download in the `/resources` directory.

2. In Haar_Cascade_Classifier.java, I used OpenCV's built-in Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection. The path to the model .xml file can be found in `../opencv/sources/data/haarcascades` in your computer.
